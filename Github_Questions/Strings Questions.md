# ðŸ§µ C++ String â€“ Practice Problem Set

This set focuses on string handling, manipulation, and character-based logic in C++. Divided into 4 categories from beginner to DSA-level.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Category 1: Output-Based Questions (GATE Style)

1.
```cpp
string s = "Hello";
cout << s.length();
```

2.
```cpp
string s = "abc";
s[0] = 'z';
cout << s;
```

3.
```cpp
string s = "Test";
cout << s[2];
```

4.
```cpp
string s = "123";
cout << s + "456";
```

5.
```cpp
string s = "C++";
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) cout << s[i] << "-";
```
