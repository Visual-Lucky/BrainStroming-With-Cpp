# ðŸ§  C++ Arrays â€“ Practice Problem Set

Structured into 4 progressive categories, this set helps students master array concepts from basics to DSA-level applications.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Category 1: Output-Based Questions (GATE Style)

1.
```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
```

2.
```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for(int i = 4; i >= 0; i--) cout << arr[i] << " ";
```

3.
```cpp
int arr[] = {5, 10, 15};
for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    arr[i] += 5;
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

4.
```cpp
int arr[5] = {1};
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) cout << arr[i] << " ";
```

5.
```cpp
int arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8};
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) if(arr[i] % 4 == 0) sum += arr[i];
cout << sum;
```

## ðŸŸ¡ Category 2: Basic Array Operations

6. Take N integers from user and store in an array, then print the array in reverse.

7. Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.

8. Count total even and odd elements in an array.

9. Calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.

10. Find the second largest number in an array.

11. Search an element in an array (linear search).

12. Insert an element at a specific index in an array.

13. Delete an element at a specific index from an array.

14. Copy one array to another.

15. Count frequency of a given number in array.

## ðŸŸ  Category 3: Logic Building & Mathematical Patterns

16. Check if an array is sorted (ascending).

17. Check if the array is a palindrome.

18. Find all duplicate elements in an array.

19. Merge two arrays into one.

20. Shift all zeroes to the end (preserving order of other elements).

21. Find the most frequent element in an array.

22. Count total unique elements in an array.

23. Remove duplicate elements from an array.

24. Find sum of elements at even indices and odd indices separately.

25. Replace every negative element with 0.

## ðŸ”´ Category 4: DSA-Level Complex Problems

26. Find the leader elements in an array (each element greater than all elements to right).

27. Rotate array to the right by K steps.

28. Count number of pairs with a given sum K.

29. Implement binary search on a sorted array.

30. Find the intersection of two arrays.

31. Find the union of two arrays (without duplicates).

32. Find the first repeating element in array.

33. Check if array contains any duplicate using only loops.

34. Implement prefix sum array.

35. Rearrange array in alternating positive & negative items (order can be changed).
